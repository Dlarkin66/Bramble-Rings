<h2>What is the return policy if my ring doesnt fit?</h2>
<p>At Bramble, all my rings are handcrafted with care from the finest materials, and it takes days to complete each piece. While I would love to offer free replacements, I am a small business and unfortunately cannot afford to do so. For this reason, I highly recommend ensuring that you have the proper ring size before placing an order, as exchanges and returns due to improper size cannot be accepted.</p>

<h2>What if my ring gets lost in the mail or arrives damaged?</h2>
<p>If your ring gets lost or arrives damaged I will make you a new one free of charge!</p>

<h2>How long will my ring take to be delivered?</h2>
<p>Bramble rings typically take 1-2 weeks to complete! Shipping time varies based off of distance. </p>

<h2>Do you do custom engravings?</h2>
<p>unfortunately I do not have the equipment to engrave rings, but perhaps in the future I will add engraving as a service!</p>

<h2>How do I care for my ring?</h2>
<p>To keep your ring in good condition, it's important to take proper care of it. First, avoid wearing your ring while doing any strenuous activities or tasks that could cause damage, such as working out, gardening, or washing dishes. Additionally, try to avoid exposing your ring to harsh chemicals, such as chlorine or bleach, as they can damage or discolor the metal or gemstones. Regular cleaning is also important. You can clean your ring by gently wiping it with a soft cloth and mild soap and warm water. Rinse thoroughly and dry with a soft cloth. It's best to store your ring in a separate compartment or pouch to avoid scratching it against other jewelry or surfaces.By following these simple care instructions, you can keep your ring looking beautiful for years to come!</p>
