        <h2 class="question">How do I find my ring size?</h2>
        <hr class="question-bb">
        <p class="raleway-text">If you're looking for the perfect ring size, there are multiple methods to choose from. One option is to visit your local jeweler, which is by far the most accurate method. Alternatively, you can order a ring sizer online - this is a convenient option that I recommend if you don't feel like going out to find a professional. Or, you can print out <a href="https://worldofprintables.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Printable-Ring-Size-Chart-1.png" target="blank">this</a> handy chart and follow the instructions, although this method may not be as precise as the others. With these options in mind, you'll be able to find the perfect fit for your new ring!</p>

        <h2 class="question">What is the return policy if my ring doesnt fit?</h2>
        <hr class="question-bb">
        <p class="raleway-text">At Bramble, all my rings are handcrafted with care from the finest materials, and it takes days to complete each piece. While I would love to offer free replacements, I am a small business and unfortunately cannot afford to do so. For this reason, I highly recommend ensuring that you have the proper ring size before placing an order, as exchanges and returns due to improper size cannot be accepted.</p>

        <h2 class="question">How do I care for my ring?</h2>
        <hr class="question-bb">
        <p class="raleway-text">To keep your ring in good condition, it's important to take proper care of it. First, avoid wearing your ring while doing any strenuous activities or tasks that could cause damage, such as working out, gardening, or washing dishes. Additionally, try to avoid exposing your ring to harsh chemicals, such as chlorine or bleach, as they can damage or discolor the metal or gemstones. Regular cleaning is also important. You can clean your ring by gently wiping it with a soft cloth and mild soap and warm water. Rinse thoroughly and dry with a soft cloth. It's best to store your ring in a separate compartment or pouch to avoid scratching it against other jewelry or surfaces.By following these simple care instructions, you can keep your ring looking beautiful for years to come!</p>
